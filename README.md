**Introduction**

Earthquake is a natural calamity that has been causing loss of lives and property for
several years. The earthquakes cause the shaking of the surface resulting in lo of damage.
Also they can occur at any time so it is very difficult to take preventive measures. The after
effects of the earthquake are also very disastrous. It takes several months and years to recover
from the damage done by the earthquake. It totally destroys everything if the magnitude of
earthquake is very high and can completely ruin a city. There have been several methods
that have been used to predict earthquakes but none have been precise and accurate.
The system that I am trying to build is to predict the magnitude of earthquake based
on the historical data set. The traditional way of analysis is not advisable to use with such
big data. The volume of data is too large so there has to be a powerful tool for data analysis
